# miniRSA_toolbox (Matlab)
A few functions I wrote for getting started with Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) with temporally resolved data.  
I had ECoG\EEG\MEG in mind when writing, but maybe other stuff will work too.  
  
Work flow: 1) noise_normalization 2) calculate_rdm 3) rsa_plot_rdm  
rsa_plot_points can be used at any point along the way.  
Usage is explained inside.  
 
 
To understand what RSA is I recommend:  
* Kriegeskorte, and Kievit. "Representational geometry: integrating cognition, computation, and the brain." TICS (2013).  
  
To dive deep into the method I recommend:  
* Walther et al. "Reliability of dissimilarity measures for multi-voxel pattern analysis." Neuroimage (2016).  
* Guggenmos, Sterzer, and Cichy. "Multivariate pattern analysis for MEG: A comparison of dissimilarity measures." NeuroImage (2018).  
  
There is no citation currently associated with this toolbox, but if you are using it please let me know at gal.vishne@mail.huji.ac.il.
Also please feel free to send feedback, bug reports etc.
